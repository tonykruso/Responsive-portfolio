                <img src="C:\Users\tonyk\Basic-Portfolio\assets\images\profilepic3.jpg" alt="TonyKruso">    

                <p> My name is Anthony Kruso, but I go by Tony. I'm originally from Dayton, OH and spent my first 22 years there. 
                    I left home and moved to Florida at 22 years old to run a restaurant, moved to Nashville, TN two years later.
                    I live in Nashville for 6 years, spent majority of my time in the Logistics business.
                    My girlfriend of 3 years and I moved to New Jersey in September of 2018 for her new geologist job.
                </p>

                <p> I enjoy learning new things and overcoming challenges. I play hockey whenever I can. I love stand up comedy, I even write some jokes. 
                    I play video games in my free time and spend time with my lovely girlfriend Brenna. 
                </p>

                <p> I hope to become a web developer and use my skills to make useful and helpful programs for working people.
                    I'm a people person and love to meet new people and learn new cultures and ideas! I hope to use my extroverted personality and new coding skills to become successful in my new state of New Jersey! 
                </p>
